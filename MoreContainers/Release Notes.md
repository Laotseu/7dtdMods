**MoreContainers** is a 7 Days to Die modlet that adds new crate containers design to help you better sort your stuff in game.

**Important:** For this modlet to work properly, it needs to be installed on the **server** and **every player's computer**.

* 1.1: Rebuild assets for the new linear lighting (Alpha 19)
* 1.0: Fist official version which includes
    - New design for generic, armors, barter (trader), forge, mining, and recycle storage boxes
	- Everything is also available in half-cube format
	= All new storage boxes are added to the wood storage and furniture helper
    
None of this would have been possible without Xith work on FunWithFlags and his video tutorials.
