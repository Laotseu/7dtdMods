**PaintJobTrucks:** Add drivable FunsPims' trucks to the game
=============================================================

![PaintJobTrucks screen shot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Laotseu/7dtdMods/master/PaintjobTrucks/PaintJobTruck.png)

You've seen those ambulances and service trucks derelicts around the cities, now you can drive them! 
They are a bit harder to drive and slower than the 4x4, but they have a much more carrying capacity. 
These bad boys are your best choice for your questing or looting expeditions.

How do you get them?
--------------------

This modlet add the new trucks and everything you need to craft them in your game. Like other vehicles, you will need to either learn how to craft them through the Grease Monkey perk or by finding schematics. They are also sometimes available for sale at your favourite traders.

New in-game resources
---------------------
Be aware that in order to craft the trucks, you will need a new type of resource, Truck Part, that can only be obtained by wrenching other trucks.

Important Notes
---------------
* For this modlet to work properly, it needs to be installed on the **server** and **every player's computer**.
