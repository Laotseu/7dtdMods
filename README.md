------------------------------

<img align="left" width="55%" height="55%" hspace="8" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Laotseu/7dtdMods/master/PaintJobTrucks/PaintJobTrucks_for_readme.png" />You've seen those ambulances and service trucks derelicts around the cities, now you can drive them!
They are a bit harder to drive and slower than the 4x4, but they have a much more carrying capacity.
These bad boys are your best choice for your questing or looting expeditions.
