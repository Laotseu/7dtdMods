PaintJob: Change the colour of FinPims vehicles
===============================================

![PaintJob](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Laotseu/7dtdMods/PaintJob_v2.3/PaintJob/PaintJob.png)

How does it work?
-----------------
PaintJob allows you to change the skins of bicycles, minibikes, motorcycles, and jeeps. You first need to get a vehicle the normal way (you build it or buy from the traders). You can then use that vehicle as an ingredient to craft a different looking version. The changes are purely cosmetic, all the in-game stats and behaviours remain unchanged.

For the motorcycles, you can also change the configuration and remove the spikes, the shield or the hood.

### Important Notes
* For this modlet to work properly, it needs to be installed on the **server** and **every player's computer**.
* When you craft a new vehicle, you will lose the gas in the tank. I didn't find a way to remove the gas before crafting.
* You must remove all mods before crafting. If you try to craft using a modded vehicle, you'll get an error message about missing resources.
* You always need to go back to the white vehicle in order to change to a new skin. I did this to limit the number of new recipes.
